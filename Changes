Revision history for AnyEvent-HTTPD

0.6 Tue Jul 14 11:16:44 CEST 2009
        - fixed leaking AE::HTTPD::HTTPConnection.

0.5 Thu Jul  2 04:30:14 CEST 2009
        - applied patch from mathieu at closetwork.org to add a
          host parameter for binding.
        - removed bogus API stuff like ::Appgets or the weird
          form and response handling. AnyEvent::HTTPD should be and
          stay a simple HTTP server for simple purposes.
          If you need further sugar, please write your own modules for
          it. If you need anything ask me or look in the git repository
          at http://git.ta-sa.org/AnyEvent-HTTPD.git
        - added responded method to ::Request.
        - stop_request now also stops further handling of the request
          after the 'request' event.
        - added 'request_timeout's
        - added keep-alive support (for HTTP 1.0) (thanks to Andrey Smirnov).

        - changed the API to actually call the events for all path segments

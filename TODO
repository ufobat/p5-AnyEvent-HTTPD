11 16:32:14 <melo> Hey, just to say that the AnyEvent::HTTPD works with perl5.8
11 17:13:58 <melo> AnyEvent::HTTPD tweaks:
11 17:13:58 <melo> http://github.com/melo/anyevent--httpd/tree/master
11 17:14:27 <melo> two commits, first just cleans up current tests. Not sure you'll like that o
                   ne, but I removed the Coro dependency, can't install the damn thing :)
11 17:14:55 <melo> second one is ok: adds method() method to request, so you can decide if it w
                   as a GET or a POST
